# AutonoViz in ROS 101 üöó  
Welcome to **AutonoViz in ROS 101**, a Level 3 autonomous driving project built around the Robot Operating System (ROS). This project highlights key concepts and techniques required to develop a conditional automation system, where the vehicle can perform most driving tasks under certain conditions but may still need human intervention. This README provides an overview of the project‚Äôs objectives, architecture, and core components.

## Project Overview üöÄ
**AutonoViz in ROS 101** focuses on creating a framework for a Level 3 autonomous vehicle using ROS. The system integrates multiple sensors, processes real-time data, and controls critical driving functions (throttle, steering, braking) through a Drive-By-Wire (DBW) interface. It emphasizes not just the autonomy algorithms themselves, but also the importance of *visualizing* sensor data and system states to aid in development and debugging. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Key Objectives üéØ
1. **Sensor Integration**  
   - Learn how to configure and receive data from LIDAR, cameras, GNSS (GPS), IMU, and RADAR in ROS.
2. **GPS-Based Navigation**  
   - Implement a global path planner using GPS coordinates and waypoints.
   - Explore real-time fusion of IMU, wheel odometry, and other sources for more accurate localization.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**  
   - Use data from multiple sensors (e.g., LIDAR, RADAR, cameras) to detect and avoid obstacles dynamically.
4. **Drive-By-Wire (DBW) Control**  
   - Interface with a DBW system in ROS to convert high-level commands into low-level steering, throttle, and brake outputs.

These objectives serve as the cornerstone for building a functional Level 3 autonomous driving platform. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Core Components ‚öôÔ∏è

### Sensors ü§ñ
**LIDAR**  
- Generates a 3D point cloud to measure distances and detect obstacles.  
- Typically integrated via ROS drivers like `velodyne_driver` or `hokuyo_node`.  

**Cameras**  
- Provide visual data for lane detection, traffic light recognition, and classification.  
- Can be integrated using packages such as `usb_cam` or `cv_camera`.  

**GNSS/GPS**  
- Supplies global coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude).  
- ROS nodes like `nmea_navsat_driver` can publish to topics like `/fix`.  

**IMU**  
- Measures acceleration and angular velocity.  
- Helps track orientation changes and movement.  

**RADAR**  
- Detects objects at extended ranges and measures relative velocity.  
- Often used for adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance.  

Each sensor publishes its data to ROS topics, forming the basis of perception and localization within the autonomy stack. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### GPS-Based Navigation üõ∞Ô∏è
1. **GPS Data Processing**  
   - Subscribes to GPS data (e.g., `/fix`) and converts coordinates to a local frame.  
   - Fuses with IMU or wheel odometry to reduce noise.  

2. **Path Planning**  
   - Uses algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, or the ROS `move_base` stack for route calculation.  
   - Follows waypoints or continuous routes based on global goals.  

3. **Practical Considerations**  
   - Typical GPS accuracy (~meters) might need augmentation (e.g., RTK-GPS) for tighter control.  
   - Urban environments can degrade GPS signals, necessitating sensor fusion for reliability.  

### Obstacle Avoidance üöß
**Sensor Fusion and Perception**  
- Combine data from LIDAR, RADAR, and cameras to get a complete view of the vehicle‚Äôs surroundings.  
- Maintain a costmap (via packages like `costmap_2d`) to track detected obstacles.  

**Local Planning**  
- Rapidly replans the vehicle‚Äôs trajectory around obstacles in real time using planners like DWA or TEB.  
- Prioritizes collision-free, feasible paths while maintaining progress toward the goal.  

### Drive-By-Wire (DBW) Interface ‚ö°
1. **Overview**  
   - Replaces mechanical linkages (e.g., steering column) with electronic actuators.  

2. **ROS Integration**  
   - A dedicated DBW node receives speed and steering commands (e.g., `/cmd_vel`).  
   - It sends the corresponding low-level actuation signals for throttle, braking, and steering.  

3. **Safety Features**  
   - Watchdog nodes can override or disable DBW when driver intervention is required.

## Visualization üñ•Ô∏è
The project heavily emphasizes visualization (‚ÄúAutonoViz‚Äù). By leveraging tools such as **RViz** (for 3D sensor data) or **Python-based** libraries (for analysis and plotting), developers can rapidly interpret sensor streams, debug algorithms, and demonstrate autonomy in action. Visualization makes complex sensor interactions and path planning decisions more intuitive.

## Future Directions üîÆ
- **Advanced Sensor Fusion**: Explore Extended Kalman Filters or Graph SLAM to enhance localization.  
- **Complex Urban Scenarios**: Integrate traffic light detection, pedestrian modeling, and intersection handling.  
- **HMI Development**: Build a user-friendly interface that helps human drivers understand and supervise the autonomous system.  
- **Real-World Testing**: Validate performance in simulation (e.g., Gazebo) and then on actual hardware or test vehicles.
